I'm a data scientist and machine learning enthusiast who is passionate about building real-world solutions, with a strong focus on NLP and multimodal machine learning. In my free time I also try to stay active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/devanshu125/competitions) by participating in various competitions. Here are a few that have gone well:

- *Optiver Trading at the close*: In this competition the task was to predict the US stocks closing movements. I used a stock clustering approach for generating new features and purged cross-validation technique for training models that were a part of my [final solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close/discussion/485939) that ranked 283rd out of 4436 participants.

- *CommonLit Readability Prize*: In this competition the task was to predict the complexity of literary passages for grades 3-12 classroom use. Our [final solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlitreadabilityprize/discussion/257756) included a RoBERTa-Large model with custom attention head and layer-wise learning rate decay that ranked 88th out of 3633 participants.

- *Multilingual Abusive Comment Detection (ShareChat/Moj)*: Built a transformer-based [system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00598) for detecting abusive content across low-resource languages and ranked 2nd out of 54 teams.

After building robust data pipelines and tools to support quantitative research and signal generation, I'm now looking to transition into roles that allow me to focus more on machine learning and applied data science. If you're hiring or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
