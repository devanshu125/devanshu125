I am deeply passionate about data science and financial markets. In my free time I also try to stay active on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/devanshu125/competitions) by participating in various competitions. Here are a few that have gone well:

- *Optiver Trading at the close*: In this competition the task was to predict the US stocks closing movements. I used a stock clustering approach for generating new features and purged cross-validation technique for training models that were a part of my [final solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-trading-at-the-close/discussion/485939) that ranked 283rd out of 4436 participants.

- *CommonLit Readability Prize*: In this competition the task was to predict the complexity of literary passages for grades 3-12 classroom use. Our [final solution](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlitreadabilityprize/discussion/257756) included a RoBERTa-Large model with custom attention head and layer-wise learning rate decay that ranked 88th out of 3633 participants.

All in all, it has been fun to explore tech as well finance side of things, but I'm still learning and if you have similar interests or would like to talk about any of these topics, do reach out!

(P.S. Coffee on me if you're in Dubai :grin:)
